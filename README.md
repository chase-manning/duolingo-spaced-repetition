# Duolingo Spaced Repetition

A Chrome Browser Extension to add a Spaced Repetition mode to Duolingo :tada:  
Download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/duolingo-spaced-repetitio/kflkpdnjoccoknecjipnjeokahflebgo).

## Overview

[Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is an evidence-based learning technique that has been proven to increase the rate of information retention. It works by presenting the user with new and more difficult lessons more frequently, while older and less difficult lessons are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect :brain:

It is commonly used for studying languages, however good tooling currently only exists for flashcard based studying systems such as [Anki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)>) and [SuperMemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo). The Duolingo Spaced Repetition extention aims to bridge the amazing power of Duolingo with the proven methedology of spaced repetition by introducing a new study mode! :sparkles:

Simply install the extension and you will see a new study mode button for spaced repetition. Use the new study mode and it will auto select your study lessons based on what evidence shows will help you retain information the best! :tada:
